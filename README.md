# React Native with PNPM

Bootstrapped React Native project with Typescript with pnpm.

To Install

- Install <code>pnpm</code> with <code>npm install -g pnpm</code>
- Run <code>pnpm install</code> to install all dependencies

To rename the app, run <code>pnpx react-native-rename **newName**</code>. This package does not attempt to properly rename build artifacts such as ios/build or Cocoa Pod installation targets. After renaming your project you should clean, build, and reinstall third party dependencies to get it running properly with the new name.
